## Technologies Used

### React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create reusable UI components, manage the application state effectively, and efficiently update and render the right components when data changes. The component-based architecture of React helps in creating a dynamic and responsive user experience.

### Vercel
Vercel is a platform optimized for frontend developers, providing the best tools and services to deploy high-performance websites and applications. It supports static site generation, seamless integrations with various headless CMS and APIs, and provides excellent performance optimization. In this project, Vercel is used for:

- **Deployment**: Deploying the application. Vercel offers fast, secure, and reliable hosting, ensuring that the application is served efficiently to users. With features like automatic scaling and edge caching, Vercel guarantees optimal performance and availability.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhancing application performance. Vercel's edge network and automatic optimizations ensure that the application loads quickly and efficiently, providing a seamless user experience.

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by the original Netflix application, aiming to provide a similar user experience and functionality. The goal is to practice and demonstrate the capabilities of React and Firebase in building & deploying a Frontend application.
