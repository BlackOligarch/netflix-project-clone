## Technologies Used

### React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create reusable UI components, manage the application state effectively, and efficiently update and render the right components when data changes. The component-based architecture of React helps in creating a dynamic and responsive user experience.

### Firebase
Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. It provides a suite of tools and services to help developers build high-quality apps, including authentication, real-time databases, cloud storage, and hosting. In this project, Firebase is used for:

- **Firestore Database**: Storing user data and movie information.
- **Hosting**: Deploying the application.

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by the original Netflix application, aiming to provide a similar user experience and functionality. The goal is to practice and demonstrate the capabilities of React and Firebase in building & deploying a Frontend application.
